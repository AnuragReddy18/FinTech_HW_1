# TITLE

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
-- The company I chose to research for this homework is Venmo.

* When was the company incorporated?
-- Venmo was created in 2009. (Wikipedia)

* Who are the founders of the company?
-- The founders of the company are Andrew Kortina and Iqram Magdon-Ismail. They met as freshman roomates at
the University of Pennsylvania. (Wikipedia)

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
-- The founders wanted an easy way to split bills for movies, food, rent, tickets, etc., so they decided to 
create an app that would enable them to do so. (Wikipedia)

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
-- The company was initially given $1.3 million after 3 rounds of funding. After a short time, the company was aquired by PayPal, which now handles its 
expenses. PayPal keeps the exact amount undisclosed. (Wikipedia)


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
-- The probelm the company is trying to solve, a simple one, is to help easuly split costs/expenses. (Atlantic)

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
-- Initially, the intended customer was anyone who wanted to split bills, so college students and older. Recently, Venmo has added debit and credit card services. The payments that users make for these cards comes directly from their Venmo balance. This, while still an emerging part of the company, has the potential to disrupt operations of many large financial banks. While other apps also accomplish what Venmo does, Venmo has a social media aspect to it as well which makes it very attractive. If person A gives money to Person B, then Persons C,D,E... anyone actually, can see that transaction and what it was for. So, this social media aspect to the company is what makes the app engaging over other options. (Atlantic)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
-- Venmo, for basiclaly 95% of its current services, is entirely mobile (ios and android), so its main technology that it uses is data encyrption technolgy to ensure security of transactions as well as to block unauthorized ones. The TechStack they use is:
jQuery - A JavaScript library.
PHP- A general-purpose scripting language
Nginx - open source web server
JavaScript -, interpreted, object-oriented language
Python - an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
Java - class-based, object-oriented, language
Ruby – A dynamic, interpreted, open source programming language
React - A JavaScript library for building UIs
TypeScript –A superset of JavaScript
C# -, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language built for .NET
Go - An open source programming language
Swift - An programming language for Cocoa / Cocoa Touch.
Objective-C - The primary programming language for building software on OS X and iOS
C++ - general-purpose programming language
CSS - Cascading Style Sheets describes how HTML elements are displayed.
Moment.js - JavaScript date library
C – Widely used programming language
Perl - Widely used programming language
Lua - Embeddable scripting language
PowerShell – Microsoft Command Line Interface
Apache Thrift - Software to create services across programming languages (Atlantic)


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
-- While starting out as only a part of the mobile payment services domain, it has started to expand into the banking domain as it introduced debit and credit cards. (Primes)

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
-- 10 years ago, having a smartphone was still a relatively new idea. Most transactions happened either through cash or check. So, the mobile payment services domain itself is a new idea. For it to be expanding less than a decade later into disrupting major banks is a huge accomplishment. It is the start of an age where large institutions are not the only monetary authority. It is difficult to find someone today who hasn't used Venmo or PayPal to send or recieve money, and for a domain to cover such a wide range of people shows that the company isn't going anywhere. (Primes)

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
-- Companies or services similar to Venmo are: Zelle, Cash App, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. (Primes)

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
-- Venmo, similar to Amazon, had a very simple initial goal. It was created to help split bills and transactions. But now, it has grew to such a proportion that it is expanding into other domains and threatening the leaders of those domains. I beleive that if Venmo continues to push its agenda for increasing their credit card user base, banks will need to start lowering their rates or users will start to switch over to the FinTech company. (Ramblings)

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
-- Being that Venmo is the pioneer of mobile payment services, their sheer user base is a good measure of how successful the comapny is. They have over 75 million users. The company is doing extremely well, and it is now expanding into other domains. (Ramblings)

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
-- Venmo is the top company when it comes to mobile services. Thier user base is the largest. Their revenues are the largest. Thier valuation is the largest. In 2019 alone, the company processed over $102 billion in transactions. (Ramblings)

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
-- As a user of Venmo's services I think that if they implemented a way to invest a user's venmo balance into stocks and crypto then the company would see a large influx of older users.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
-- This addition would allow Venmo to be one app for everything financially related. You can pay people, recieve money, have a debit and credit card, and now invest as well. There would be no reason to use any other apps.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
-- This additional product would need to incorporate blockchain technology as well as machine learning. (CNBC, BuiltIn, Investopedia)

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
-- These technologies are appropriate for my solution beacuase they will help to implement a successful stock brokerage system as well as a crypto system. In addition to that, the top companies that currently have stock/crypto services use these technologies the most. (CNBC, BuiltIn, Investopedia)
